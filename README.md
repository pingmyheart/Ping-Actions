## üöÄ Overview

*Ping-Actions* is a curated collection of personal GitHub Actions and workflow templates aimed at streamlining CI/CD
processes across various programming languages. This repository serves as a centralized hub for reusable workflows,
facilitating consistent and efficient automation in your projects.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **.github/workflows**: Contains reusable workflow templates for different programming languages.
- **.github/actions**: Custom GitHub Actions for specific tasks.

## Usage

Action uses a dispatcher to manage workflows. The dispatcher is a simple script that takes the action name as an input
and runs the corresponding workflow.

### Docker Maven Dispatcher

      - 'v*'

permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
  pages: write
  actions: write

jobs:
  ci:
    secrets: inherit
    uses: pingmyheart/Ping-Actions/.github/workflows/dispatcher.yml@main
    with:
      project-type: docker-maven
      java-version: 17
```
